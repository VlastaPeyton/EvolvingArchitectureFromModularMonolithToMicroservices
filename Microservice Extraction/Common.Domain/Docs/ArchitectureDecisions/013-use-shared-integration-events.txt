Problem:
	InitialArchitecture je imao in-memory event bus za inter-module komunikaciju, a i ovde cu nastaviti to, sve dok ne dodjem do microservices kada cu koristiti RabbitMQ.
	With modular-monolith we had to decide what to do - should we keep local contracts in each module (and then need to redevelop in-memory event bus or replace it with some message queue) or just create another project for a module which sends the integration event (and that can be referenced by receiver).

Decision:
	Module that Publishes integration event will have its own project with integration event.
	Subscriber module can reference only this project. When there will be a need to replace in-memory queue with RabbitMQ, we will consider moving to local contracts (each module has its own event definition).

Consequences:
	Laka implementacija. 
	Subscriber module must reference Publishing module (TIGHT COUPLING koji je problem bas).
	Receiving module might not want all the data from the sender’s event but has to use the defined contract - data redundancy
