Problem:
	Contracts module se cesto unapredjuje, a trenutno je Monolith app i onda mora da se redeploy. 
 
Decision:
	Extract Contracts module out of the Monolith and develop it as a separate microservice.

Consequences:
	Independence: Each team can work, manage, and deploy their services independently, allowing the contracts team to focus solely on their module’s functionality and performance.
	Easier Concurrent User Handling: As the contracts module will be its own microservice, it can be scaled independently, making it easier to handle a large number of concurrent users without affecting other parts of the application.
	Improved Agility: Teams can make frequent updates to their respective microservices without the need to coordinate with other teams, enhancing the overall agility of our development process.
	Increased Complexity: Introducing microservices adds complexity in terms of deployment, service communication, and data management. Appropriate strategies for handling these challenges should be defined.
