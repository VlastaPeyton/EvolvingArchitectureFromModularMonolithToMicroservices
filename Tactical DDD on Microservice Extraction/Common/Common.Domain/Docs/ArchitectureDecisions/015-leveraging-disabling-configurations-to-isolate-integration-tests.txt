Problem:
	Do sada, integration test trazili su setup in-memory db for all modules. 
  Managing these databases has become a cumbersome process, and we want to run integration tests in isolation to achieve modularity and ease of testing.

Decision:
	Disable certain modules during the execution of integration tests. Only the essential modules required for the functionality being tested will be active

Consequences:
	Each test will involve fewer modules, which will help to isolate failures and simplify debugging
	With fewer active modules, tests will consume fewer system resources, potentially improving test performance.
