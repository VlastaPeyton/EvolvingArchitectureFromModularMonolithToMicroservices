Problem:
	The Contracts module’s business logic is becoming more complex in the current project state, with an increasing number of negative scenarios that need to be handled.
	Current error handling approach is based on exceptions, that are expensive in terms of performance.
	Exceptions are 10 times slower than other error handling approaches like Result type.
	Result type is easier to understand and follow + 10x faster + easier to maintain...

Decision:
	Result type approach for error handling in Contracts microservice.

Consequences:
	Result type approach simplifies domain logic. Error flow is easy to follow. Performance improved.
